              I'm a digital product designer with over a decade of making the
              complex feel simple. My background spans fintech, AI, Web3, and
              consumer apps, with products shipped to millions of users across
              more than 65 countries. I've led design for companies with market
              caps over $1B, built many systems from scratch, taught
              professionally, mentored teams, and worked hands-on across
              research, UX, and visual design.

              I'm drawn to design as a way of making senseâ€”and making things
              make sense. My process is shaped by systems thinking,
              philosophical curiosity, and a respect for the hidden logic
              beneath the surface. I believe good design reveals structure,
              invites clarity, and brings coherence to complexity.
